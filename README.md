# Bike MD 2.o
#### See the live site [HERE](bike-md.herokuapp.com)
Bike MD is a community based site for motorcycle technicians and owners, a place where they can connect with each other and ask technical questions, browse common problems and solutions by model, and help each other troubleshoot bikes more efficiently. This website was originally built as a final project for the Iron Yard. It was developed with Python, Django, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL. The goal for 2.0 is to port the front end into an Ember framework. The back end
will still be a Django rest framework based API...Please see https://github.com/Josiah-DuBose/bike-md-FE for the front
end portion of the app.
