# Bike MD 2.0
#### See the live site [HERE](bike-md.herokuapp.com)
Bike MD is a community based site for motorcycle technicians and owners, a place where they can connect with each other and ask technical questions, browse common problems and solutions by model, and help each other troubleshoot bikes more efficiently. This website was originally built as a final project for the Iron Yard. The goal for version 2.0 is to decouple the backend making it a stand alone API. Also, I'm working on automating DB updates using python scripts and adding more robust filtering to improve response time. The front end will mostly likely be in REACT or VUE but that is still to be determined.
