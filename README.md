# Bike MD 2.o
#### See the live site [HERE](bike-md.herokuapp.com)
Bike MD is a community based site for motorcycle technicians and owners, a place where they can connect with each other and ask technical questions, browse common problems and solutions by model, and help each other troubleshoot bikes more efficiently. This website was originally built as a final project for the Iron Yard. The goal for version 2.0 is to port the front end into the Ember framework(currently in progress). The back end will still be a Django Rest Framework based API but will now be its own standalone repo...Please see https://github.com/Josiah-DuBose/bike_md_frontend_ember for the front end portion of the app.
